# Skill: Cover Letter Writer

## When to Use
When the user needs to write a cover letter for a job application.

## Behavior
- Always ask for the job description, their relevant experience, and why they want this role
- Never write a generic letter — always reference the specific company and role
- Lead with impact, not "I am writing to apply for..."
- Keep it to 3 paragraphs maximum
- Mirror language from the job description naturally
- End with a confident, specific call to action

## Structure
Paragraph 1 — The Hook: why you, why this company, why now.
Paragraph 2 — The Evidence: 1-2 specific achievements with numbers that match what they want.
Paragraph 3 — The Close: enthusiasm plus clear next step.

## Rules
- No "I am a hard worker" — show it, do not say it
- Under 300 words
- No longer than one page

# Skill: CV / Resume Writer

## When to Use
When the user needs to write, update, or improve their CV or resume.

## Behavior
- Ask for their work history, target role, and the job description if available
- Focus on achievements not duties — Led a team of 8 to deliver X resulting in Y beats Managed a team
- Use strong action verbs: Led, Built, Reduced, Grew, Launched, Saved, Designed
- Quantify everything possible: percentages, money, time saved, team size, users impacted
- 1 page for under 5 years experience, 2 pages maximum for senior roles
- Tailor to the job description — mirror their language naturally
- Standard formatting only — no tables or text boxes, ATS-friendly

## CV Structure
1. Name and contact details
2. Professional summary (3 lines: who you are, what you do, what you bring)
3. Work experience (reverse chronological, achievements over duties)
4. Education
5. Skills (relevant only)

## Achievement Formula
Action verb + what you did + result with number
Example: Reduced customer onboarding time by 40% by redesigning the welcome email sequence

# Skill: Event Planner

## When to Use
When the user is planning any kind of event — birthday, dinner party, wedding, gathering.

## Behavior
- Ask: event type, number of guests, budget, date, venue, and vibe
- Work backwards from the event date with a timeline
- Suggest themes achievable without professional help
- Always include a day-of checklist
- Flag things that need to be booked far in advance
- Offer budget-friendly alternatives for every suggestion

## Planning Timeline
6+ weeks before: Book venue, send invites, confirm vendors
2-4 weeks before: Finalise menu, plan activities, confirm headcount
1 week before: Shop for non-perishables, prep decorations
Day before: Prep food, set up, confirm RSVPs
Day of: Hour-by-hour rundown

## Output Format
Event concept summary, shopping and booking list with costs, day-of timeline, and 3 things that could go wrong with solutions.

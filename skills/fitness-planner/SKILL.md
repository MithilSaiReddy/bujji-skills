# Skill: Fitness Planner

## When to Use
When the user asks about workouts, exercise plans, or physical fitness goals.

## Behavior
- Always ask: current fitness level, available equipment, time per session, and goal
- Start conservatively — it is better to underestimate than injure someone
- Always include warm-up and cool-down
- Explain the purpose of each exercise in plain English
- Flag high injury risk exercises and offer alternatives
- Include rest days — recovery is part of the plan
- Never give medical advice or diagnose injuries

## Plan Structure
State the goal, frequency per week, and session length.
Give a table with Day / Focus / Exercises.
For each exercise: sets x reps, rest time, and one form tip.
Suggest a 4-week reassessment with 3 signs the plan is working.

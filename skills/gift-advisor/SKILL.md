# Skill: Gift Advisor

## When to Use
When the user needs gift ideas for someone.

## Behavior
- Always ask: who is it for, what is the occasion, what is the budget, and what do you know about their interests
- Suggest a range from practical to sentimental to experiential
- Avoid generic gifts unless there is no information about the recipient
- Consider the relationship: close friend vs colleague vs parent vs partner
- Suggest personalisation ideas that make a standard gift special
- Flag lead times for custom or shipping-heavy gifts

## Output Format
Give 5 ideas at different price points, each with:
- Gift name and approximate price
- One sentence on why this works for this person
- Where to get it or how to arrange it

## Budget Tiers
Under 20: thoughtful, personal, consumable or experience-based
20-50: quality item or small experience
50-150: meaningful experience or quality keepsake
150+: ask more questions — this should feel very personal

# Skill: Meal Planner

## When to Use
When the user wants help with meal planning, recipes, grocery lists, or what to cook.

## Behavior
- Always ask about dietary restrictions, allergies, and preferences first
- Consider budget constraints when mentioned
- Suggest meals that reuse ingredients across the week to reduce waste
- Keep recipes simple unless the user asks for something elaborate
- Provide estimated prep time for every recipe
- Account for how many people are being cooked for

## Output Format
For weekly plans:
| Day | Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner |
|-----|-----------|-------|--------|

Always follow the meal plan with a combined shopping list grouped by:
- Produce
- Protein
- Dairy
- Pantry

For individual recipes: ingredients list first, then numbered steps, then tips.

# Skill: Negotiation Coach

## When to Use
When the user needs to negotiate — salary, price, contract terms, or workplace conflict.

## Behavior
- Understand the situation fully before giving tactics
- Normalise negotiation — it is expected, not rude
- Help them identify their BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) first
- Anchor high but stay reasonable
- Prepare specific responses for the most common pushbacks

## Core Principles
- Silence is powerful — after making an ask, stop talking
- Anchor first — the first number sets the frame
- Never accept the first offer even if it is good
- Make it about market rate, not personal need
- Always get agreements in writing

## For Salary Negotiation
1. Research market rate
2. Build case with achievements and market data
3. Script the exact words to say
4. Prepare for "that is our best offer"
5. Decide walk-away number in advance

## Output Format
Give exact scripts: opening line, response if they say X, response if they say Y.

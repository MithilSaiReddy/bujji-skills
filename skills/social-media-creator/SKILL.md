# Skill: Social Media Creator

## When to Use
When the user needs help creating social media content, captions, or a content strategy.

## Behavior
- Always ask which platform — tone differs massively between them
- Ask about their audience and what they want people to feel or do
- Write in the user's voice — ask for examples of their existing content if available
- Instagram: emotional, visual, storytelling
- LinkedIn: professional insight with personal story
- Twitter/X: punchy, opinionated, conversational
- TikTok: hook in first 2 seconds, informal
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags, not 30 random ones

## Caption Format
Hook (first line that stops the scroll)
Body (story or value)
CTA (what to do next: comment, save, share)
Hashtags

## Content Ideas Format
Give 5 ideas each with a post type and hook/angle.

# Skill: Study Planner

## When to Use
When the user is a student needing help with studying, revision, exams, or managing workload.

## Behavior
- Ask about the exam/deadline date, subject, current understanding level, and available time
- Use evidence-based techniques: spaced repetition, active recall, interleaving
- Break big subjects into manageable chunks
- Build in breaks using the Pomodoro technique (25 min study, 5 min break)
- Never recommend cramming as a strategy

## Study Techniques
- Active recall: close the book and write everything you remember
- Spaced repetition: review after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks
- Feynman technique: explain it as if teaching a 10-year-old
- Past papers: the single most effective exam prep tool
- Mind mapping: for subjects with lots of connected concepts

## Study Plan Format
1. List all topics
2. Rate each topic 1-5 for confidence
3. Build day-by-day schedule working backwards from the exam
4. Include buffer days for weak areas
5. Plan the day before: light review only, early sleep
